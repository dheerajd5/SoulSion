One of the most common issue in this era is Mental Health issue, be it depression, axiety, peer pressure, social awkwardness and many more, how often have you been able to talk about it with your friends and closed ones? Rarely right? We feel you. Hence, Soul Sion was started with the initiative to eradicate mental health issues from the root level. We are more than excited to have you on-board and be a part of this community where we thrive to work in addressing problems which although being very prevalent are not openly talked about. 

In this following section, we will give you overview of what the project is all about and present different sections / areas you can make contributions to. Please note that <mark>Skills Required</mark> need not necessarily mean that you must know those. It means we are working with that particular tech stack, and expect you to work with the same. If you don't know it yet, but are willing to put your time and effort to learn it, we happy that you are here. And yes, this can be a great way to work in a real world project while learning!!
